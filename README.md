## What Are Candlestick Shadows?

Candlestick shadows (also known as wicks or tails) show the price range
beyond the opening and closing price. During the given period, they
indicate the highest and lowest points. A higher shadow indicates a high
price, while a lower shadow indicates a low price.

## Types of Candlestick Shadows

-   **Upper Shadows:** Indicate the highest price point of the session.
-   **Lower Shadows:** Indicate the lowest price point of the session.
-   **Long Upper and Lower Shadows:** Indicate a high level of market
    indecision.
-   **Wide Range Candles:** Indicate high volatility and high trading
    activity.
-   **Green and Red Candles:** Green candles indicate a higher closing
    price than the opening price, while red candles indicate a lower
    closing price.
-   **Bullish Engulfing Patterns:** Signal a major reversal in the
    trend.

## Technical Analysis of Candle Shadow Trading Strategies

Technical analysis is a trading discipline that uses various charting
tools, indicators, and patterns to predict the price movement of future
securities. Candlestick charts and candle shadow analysis within them
are key elements of technical analysis.

A candle\'s shadow, or wick, can provide valuable insight into price
action during a particular period. Depending on their length, you can
determine the strength of buying or selling pressure and the highs and
lows they have reached. Trading strategies can be developed using candle
shadows and other technical analysis tools in conjunction with candle
shadows.

Various technical analysis tools are available to traders on the Quotex
platform for analyzing candle shadows. Examples of technical indicators
would be trend lines, resistance, support levels, and moving averages.

In addition to helping traders identify potential entry and exit points,
manage their risk, and make more informed decisions, candle shadow
analysis may also aid traders in making more profitable decisions.

Candle shadow trading strategies often involve looking for long shadows
that cross or touch trend lines, resistances, or supports. The longer
the upper shadow, the more likely it is that the price will reverse to
the downside if it breaks through resistance levels. Long lower shadows
can also touch support levels, signaling that a bearish reversal is
likely when the level has held.

An alternative strategy involves identifying long shadows on overbought
or oversold stocks. An asset in overbought conditions might show a long
upper shadow, signaling a potential candle structure trading bearish
shadow reversal. However, an asset in oversold conditions could receive
a bullish reversal signal if a long lower shadow forms.

## Using Technical Indicators to Identify Potential Reversals in Price Movement

In technical analysis, the price and volume of an asset help to
calculate mathematical formulas. Traders can use them to predict future
price movements based on their unique perspective on market data. It is
possible to identify potential reversals in price movement when combined
with candle shadow analysis.

Several technical indicators are accessible on the Quotex platform, such
as moving averages, relative strength indices (RSIs), moving average
convergence divergence (MACDs), and Bollinger Bands. There are a variety
of ways in which each of these indicators can give different insights
into market conditions. They can also complement candle shadow analysis
in several different ways.

Regarding momentum oscillators, the RSI measures how fast and how often
prices change. When the indicator oscillates between zero and one
hundred, it indicates an overbought or oversold condition. An RSI above
70 indicates an overbought asset, and an RSI below 30 indicates an
oversold asset.

With candle shadow trading, long upper shadows could indicate a
potential bearish reversal if the RSI exceeds 70. The asset may be due
for a price correction because the long upper shadow suggests buyers
cannot sustain the high prices.

RSIs below 30 indicate a potential bullish reversal when a long lower
shadow forms. In this case, the long lower shadow suggests that sellers
could not keep the price low, and the oversold conditions suggest that a
bounce in price may be looming.

Trading on the Quotex platform is made more informed by combining candle
shadow analysis with technical indicators, which can help traders
identify potential reversal points more accurately.
